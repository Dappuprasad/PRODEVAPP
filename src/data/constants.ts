export const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What exactly does ProDev do?",
    a: "ProDev provides complete product teams to help you build your product. That's everyone you need on the product side from a CTO level engineer to full-stack developers to a product manager, designer and tester. The team focuses on helping you build your vision and get to a funding ready, revenue-generating product as quickly as possible.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the process like?",
    a: "Our structured approach ensures a seamless journey from idea to market-ready product, including deep dives, user stories, wireframing, development, launch, and long-term scaling.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who owns the IP and product?",
    a: "You own 100% of the product, the IP and the code.",
  },
  {
    q: "What flexibility does ProDev offer?",
    a: "A startup's requirements are always evolving. ProDev gives you the flexibility to scale your team up or down based on your requirements.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you work with non-technical founders?",
    a: "Absolutely. We guide non-technical founders through product strategy, design, development, and launch-turning ideas into fully functional products.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do we sign an NDA?",
    a: "You bet! We're here solely to help bring your vision to life-your intellectual property always remains completely yours.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do we take any equity?",
    a: "In some cases, we offer funding for a small portion of equity. This is determined on a case-by-case basis.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens on the first call?",
    a: "On our first call, we'll touch on the core problem you're trying to solve and how you think we should go about it. We'll share our experience about the technology required, the industry and the business model. We'll also be able to give you an estimate on the timeline and estimated cost on the call itself — no hidden pricing and asking for multiple follow up calls.",
  },
  {
    q: "What tech stack do we use?",
    a: "We have a diverse range of expertise when it comes to technology stacks. We specialize in JavaScript stacks, including MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) which are ideal for web development. Additionally, for mobile app development, we are well-versed in React Native. Beyond JavaScript, we also have specialists in Python, Flutter, Swift, and Kotlin making us flexible and capable of adapting to various project requirements.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are you like Bubble and other no code platforms?",
    a: "We are not a platform and founders who work with us aren't locked into any platform. The final deliverable if you choose to work with ProDev will be a unique, fully-customizable codebase that is independent of any 3rd parties and which you have 100% ownership of.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it typically take to build a product and how much does it cost?",
    a: "We aim to build products within 45 days and in less than $15K.",
  },
  {
    q: "What makes ProDev different from other development agencies?",
    a: "Most development agencies treat startups like short-term contracts. We're a venture studio—your business-building partner. We help you go from idea to first customers in under 45 days, often for less than $15K, and we're invested in your long-term success.",
  },
